*smarttill* is a Vim plugin to provide {motion}s like |t| and |T|, but they
are smarter than the built-in ones in some sense.  For example, if you edit
the following text and you want to delete a partial text from the cursor till
before a comma, you have to type "dt," (here "|" means the cursor position):

		...|Yo DJ, pump this party! ...
		    ^^^^^

But it's somewhat annoying to type another character to specify where the
cursor should be moved to explicitly.  It's useful if there is a motion to
move the cursor till before comma, period or other punctuations without
specifying a character.  smarttill provides the features as
|<Plug>(smarttill-t)| and |<Plug>(smarttill-T)|.

See also |smarttill-examples| for customization.
